        <h1>look i just want my own website leave me alone</h1>
        <p>I'm cute and welcome mreoww</p>
        <p>Here are the minimum required materials:

            -A vacuum chamber, preferably in a spherical shape
            -A roughing vacuum pump capable of reaching at least 75 microns vacuum
            -A secondary high vacuum pump, either a turbo pump or oil diffusion pump
            -A high voltage supply, preferably capable of at least 40kv 10ma - Must be negative polarity
            -A high voltage divider probe for use with a digital multimeter
            -A thermocouple or baratron (of appropriate scale) vacuum gauge
            -A neutron radiation detector, either a proportional He-3 or BF3 tube with counting instrumentation, or a bubble dosimeter
            -A Geiger counter, preferably a scintillator type, for x-ray detection and safety
            -Deuterium gas (can be purchased as a gas or extracted from D2O through electrolysis - it is much easier and more effective to use compressed gas)
            -A large ballast resistor in the range of 50-100k and at least a foot long
            -A camera and TV display for viewing the inside of the reactor
            -Lead to shield the camera viewport
            -General engineering tools, a machine shop if at all possible (although 90% of mine was built with nothing but a dremel and cordless drill, the only thing you really can't build without a shop is scratch building the vacuum chamber)</p>
