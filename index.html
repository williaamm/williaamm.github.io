        <h1>look i just want my own website leave me alone</h1>
        <p>I'm cute and welcome mreoww</p>
        <p>Here are the minimum required materials:</p>
        <p>- A vacuum chamber, preferably in a spherical shape</p>
        <p>- A roughing vacuum pump capable of reaching at least 75 microns vacuum</p>
        <p>- A secondary high vacuum pump, either a turbo pump or oil diffusion pump</p>
        <p>- A high voltage supply, preferably capable of at least 40kv 10ma - Must be negative polarity</p>
        <p>- A high voltage divider probe for use with a digital multimeter</p>
        <p>- A thermocouple or baratron (of appropriate scale) vacuum gauge</p>
        <p>- A neutron radiation detector, either a proportional He-3 or BF3 tube with counting instrumentation, or a bubble dosimeter</p>
        <p>- A Geiger counter, preferably a scintillator type, for x-ray detection and safety</p>
        <p>- Deuterium gas (can be purchased as a gas or extracted from D2O through electrolysis - it is much easier and more effective to use compressed gas)</p>
        <p>- A large ballast resistor in the range of 50-100k and at least a foot long</p>
        <p>- A camera and TV display for viewing the inside of the reactor</p>
        <p>- Lead to shield the camera viewport</p>
        <p>- General engineering tools, a machine shop if at all possible (although 90% of mine was built with nothing but a dremel and cordless drill, the only thing you really can't build without a shop is scratch building the vacuum chamber)</p>
