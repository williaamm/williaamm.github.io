    How to use this program
</h1>
<h1>
	key
</h1>
<p>
    your <strong>key</strong> is the current data that you have associated with your account. it contains any task information provided by the user. <br>
	in the program, you can import your key by pasting it into the appropriate text box, loading all information provided by the key into the program.<br>
	in the event of you leaving the program, you can export your current key, which can be saved separately and pasted in the next time you enter the program.<br>
	both the import and export functions can be found on buttons on the main page.
</p>
<h2>
	<br>
	validation
</h2>
<p>
	if you attempt to put in a key that is invalid (not matching the format expected by the program), the program will alert you and will have the task box remain empty.

</p>
<br>
<h1>
	adding new tasks
</h1>
<p>
    adding a new task to the list can be done by clicking the "add task" button on the main page. the program will prompt you to fill in three fields.
	<br>
	the <strong>enter your task</strong> field is the main title of the task given, and will be displayed next to the date.
	<br>
	the <strong>enter your task date</strong> field prompts the user to enter the date of the task given via a date selector, in which a user can type in a date or select one using the calendar icon.
	<br>
	the <strong>task description</strong> field allows the user to enter a description of the task given. this field is not required, and can be left blank.
	
</p>
<h2>
	<br>
	validation
</h2>
<p>
	the program will not let you add a task if either the task title or the task date fields are left blank. if the task description field is left blank, the program will still allow you to add the task.

</p>
<br>
<h1>
	calendar
</h1>
<p>
    the calendar display acts as a guide for you to locate your tasks. by default, it displays the current month, and, using the buttons, can locate the previous and next month. the calendar will display the days of the week each date will land on, with the first column being sunday, the second being monday, etc. with the last column being saturday.
